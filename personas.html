                    <h2 id="about-interface">About the Interface</h2>
                    <p>I chose to a treadmill that is in my village’s gym as an interface to understand its user interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>Treadmill is for walking and running indoor. The main components of the treadmill I chose are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Console and monitors</b> - Users change speed and incline on the console and see the information, including heart rate, calories, and distance from the monitors. The second sketch contains the details about the console and the
                            monitors.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Pulse sensor</b> - Users can measure their heart rate by placing their hands on the pulse sensor.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Handrail</b> - Users can use the handrails for support and stability. </li>
                        <li><b>Walking belt</b> - Walking belt moves backward, forcing the user to walk or run until they pause or stop the machine.</li>
                        <li><b>Foot rail</b> - Users can stop moving by placing their feet on the foot rails.</li>
                        <li><b>Water bottle placement</b> - Beside the console is a water bottle placement that holds a bottle or a cup while the user is exercising.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>All of them did not read the instruction or ask the staff how to use it. 1 of them tried to set the speed before pressing ‘start’; this action is not supported in this machine. Probably, he is a new user. </li>
                        <li>None of them used ‘mode’ and ‘prog’ buttons. </li>
                        <li>All of them used the buttons for a specific speed and incline. 4 of them adjusted the speed afterward. 3 of them held the adjusting speed button to reach their desire speed quickly. That means the speed and incline controls are
                            useful, but many people still need some further adjustments.</li>
                        <li>3 of them used the ‘pause’ button. None of them used an emergency stop button. Instead, they stopped using the ‘stop’ button. </li>
                        <li>All of them placed their personal belongings in the water bottle placement. 3 of them placed their mobile phones on the stand, and 2 out of 3 watched shows while exercising.</li>
                        <li>2 of them placed their hands on the pulse sensor. One of them did it briefly, while the other did it for around 10 minutes. 3 of them used foot rails at least once. 2 of them uses it before pausing.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="interview-questions">Interviewing Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What is your motivation to exercise using this treadmill?</li>
                        <li>What functions and components are you looking for in a treadmill?</li>
                        <li>Do you ever use another design of a treadmill? How is this one compared that the other?</li>
                        <li>Is there a button or a monitor that confuses you? Is there a button or a monitor that you never use?
                        </li>
                        <li>If you use the handrails, the foot rails, or the pulse sensor, how do you feel using them? (i.e., Do they fit your physical?)</li>
                        <li>Do you have any other suggestions about the functionality of this particular treadmill?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 id="intervews">Interviews from 3 users</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One user claimed that she usually went to another gym, but today she was busy, so she had to use this one, which is near her house. One said that he used the treadmill because it was raining outside. Another user said that she
                            wants to watch TV shows while running, so she came to the gym.</li>
                        <li>All said that speed and incline controls – buttons for quick speed and incline – and the monitors showing speed, incline, time, distance, and calories are important. Two of them mentioned that the emergency stop function was also
                            essential. One of them said that every treadmill should have a heart rate measuring function, and another said she wants a cooling down function. </li>
                        <li>All claimed that the lap monitor confused them and never used 'mode' and 'prog' buttons. One of them barely looked at the heart rate monitor. </li>
                        <li>Two out of three have encountered a different treadmill before. All liked that this treadmill has a phone stand and speed and incline controls. One expressed her desire for the treadmill to have a user-specific setting and different
                            numbers in the speed control. The other asked for a cool down button and adjusting speed buttons at a handrail. </li>
                        <li>All used foot rails. Two out of three said they used handrails, and only one interviewee used the pulse sensor. Two of them said the handrails are too think. One of the users thought that the handrails and the pulse sensor did
                            not fit her physical, so she did not use them. No one criticized the foot rails.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Demographically, all of the interviewees are a villager who is accessible to the treadmill. Two of them are middle-age, while another is a teenager. </p>

                <!-- Personas-->
                <div class="project-section">

                    <h3 id="persona1">Persona 1: Busy Sarah</h3>
                    <p>Sarah is a middle-aged woman who has two kids and owns a business. She is impatient and very busy, yet she takes care of her health and must exercise three times a week. She usually goes to a professional gym, but she will come to
                        use the free, small one in her village if she misses it. Her gym routine always starts with a fast walk with high inclination on a treadmill. </p>
                    <img class="emphaty-map" src="img/personas/Sarah-empathy-map.jpg" alt="Busy Sarah's empathy map">
                    <p>Sarah represents a user with a professional gym membership who uses this middle-level treadmill due to a busy schedule. Since the user always goes to the gym, she is confident with the machine and can compare this particular interface
                        with a similar treadmill she has encountered. Kate is also a user who walks with inclination instead of run, so handrails are essential for her. </p>

                    <h3 id="persona2">Persona 2: Lively Kate</h3>
                    <p>Kate is a calm, lively, and laid-back college. To relieve stress, she hangs out with her friends and watches her favorite TV series on Netflix. She doesn’t regularly exercise; she only does so when she gains weight. She usually prefers
                        to go to the gym because she can simultaneously watch Netflix. </p>
                    <img class="emphaty-map" src="img/personas/Kate-empathy-map.jpg" alt="Lively Kate's empathy map">
                    <p>Kate represents a user who goes to the gym sometimes, but not so often. As an amateur, this kind of user does not require advanced functionality. She is also a user who loves entertainment, so she needs to watch shows or listen to
                        music while exercising. She, therefore, focuses heavily on whether the treadmill includes a phone stand. </p>

                    <p>This storyboard is about Kate's journey on using the threadmill. Her goal is to exercising while watching TV shows at the same time. Since she does not focus much on the advanced functions except that the treadmill allows her to run
                        at one place and watch Netflix simultaneously, her goal is met.</p>
